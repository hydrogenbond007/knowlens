# knowlens
DAO documentation is really messy. It's such a fast moving space that, in the time it takes to refine a piece of information you produce, you could have produced more information. Knowlens aims to save time for contributors and improve documentation quality by automatically summarizing their documentation, and merging it with their peers.
